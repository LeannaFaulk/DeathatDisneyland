<p>
	On July 8, 1974, nine days after the attraction opened, 18-year-old hostess Deborah Gail Stone was accidentally crushed to death between two walls of building between 10:35 p.m. and 10:40 p.m. A narrow channel between a stationary wall and a rotating wall was as the rotating wall began to move (it moved every 2 to 4 minutes which was how long each act was). Her death was pronounced at 11:00 p.m., when the carousel was being reset for a new cycle. One of the audience members heard Stone's screams and notified park staff. Other employees didn't notice the dismembered until the end of the show and thought that Deborah's death screams were part of the show. By the time the audience member and the staff got to her, it was too late. Stone died from her injuries. Stone's parents sued Disneyland for the death of their daughter, which resulted in a small settlement.

<p>
	After Stone's accident, the attraction was abruptly closed down and remained closed which safety lights were being installed. Later on, the walls in the theatre were remodeled so that they would break away in case a similar accident happened. The attraction reopened three days after the incident on July 11. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/America_Sings" target="_blank"> America Sings</a> officially closed on Sunday, April 10, 1988.

<h3>Big Thunder Mountain Railroad</h3>

<p>
	On September 5, 2003, a 22-year-old man died after suffereing severe blunt force trauma and extensive internal bleeding in a derailment of the Big Thunder Mountain Railroad roller coaster that also injured ten other riders. The cause of the accident was determined to be improper maintenance. Investigation reports and discovery by the victim's attorney confirmed the fatal injuries occurred when the first passenger car collided with the underside of the locomotive. The derailment was the result of a mechanical failure which occurred due to omissions during a maintenance procedure. 
</p>

<p>
	As the train entered the tunnel, the axle came loose and jammed against a brake section, causing the locomotive to become airborne and hit the ceiling of the tunnel. The locomotive then fell on top of the first passenger car, crushing the victim. Some people blamed the new cost-conscious maintenance culture brought in by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Pressler" target="_blank"> Paul Pressler</a> and consultants McKinsey & Company in 1997, which included Reliability-centered maintenance.

<p>
	In August 1967, a 17-year-old boy form Hawthrone, California was killed while jumping between two moving <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PeopleMover" target="_blank"> PeopleMover</a> cars as the ride was passing through a tunnel. He stumbled and fell onto the track, where an oncoming train of cars crushed him beneath its wheels and dragged his body a few hundred feet before it was stopped by a ride operator. The attraction had only been open for one month at the time.
